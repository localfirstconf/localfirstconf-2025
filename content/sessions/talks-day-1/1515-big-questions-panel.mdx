This panel discussion brings together Martin Kleppmann, Aaron Boodman, and Peter van Hardenburg to discuss the big questions before the Local First movement today. What's the relationship between sync engines technology and the broader ideals of Local First? What monetization approaches are possible for software developers? And is the rise of AI a friend or a foe to Local First's aims?

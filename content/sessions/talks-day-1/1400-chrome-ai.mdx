In this talk, I'll give an overview of Chrome's built-in AI efforts and do a rundown of the various built-in APIs, like the Translation and Language Detection APIs, the Writer and Rewriter APIs, the Summarizer API, and, of course, the Prompt API (on the Web and in extensions). I'll also cover the multimodal APIs the team is working on. The objective of the talk is to teach everyone enough about these APIs so they become productive and can start experimenting.

When we set out to make local-first mainstream with Jazz, the two ideas that excited us the most were: a much simpler stack (no backend, nothing to integrate) â€” and: a much more declarative approach to writing apps (just a schema, plus UI).

Turns out that these make local-first perfectly suited for vibe-coding. In particular, we'll also show you how that's influenced our API design and how Jazz's unique local-first permissions might be the missing piece to make vibe-coded apps secure and production-ready with no extra work.

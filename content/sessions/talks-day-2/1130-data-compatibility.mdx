We've mastered sync engines and killed the spinners, but we're still failing at a core promise: users have no more control over their data than they did five years ago.

Why? Data is still trapped in proprietary formats inside apps. We're getting data to the device but not to the user's "premises"—that's the Last Mile Problem of local-first software.

The good news: Framework authors solved the hard technical problems, now app developers can solve the final piece. I'll show you three levels that unlock true user ownership: basic export, continuous projection, and bi-directional sync.

Get this right and users control their data across applications forever—no more digital sharecropping, just data that flows freely between tools and outlives companies.

Local-first is transforming how businesses operate, improving revenue through higher uptime, streamlining operations by reducing dependencies, and delivering smoother customer experiences through real-time responsiveness. As expectations grow though, businesses are facing emerging needs that legacy architectures struggle to meet. This talk explores how the shift to local-first is revealing the cracks in traditional networking and why meeting modern demands for reliability, low latency, and real-time coordination will require rethinking the stack itself.

Let's look at how these businesses are future-proofing with local-first!

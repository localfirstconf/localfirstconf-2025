This presentation is going to showcase hard lessons learned from (slightly) over 15 years of building offline-capable applications. These projects could not have been realised without local-first technology and yet, that was not the most important aspect about them. Instead, they helped save countless lives. These projects are: Fighting Ebola, a COVID Vaccination Supply Chain and Route Planning for Humanitarian Disaster Relief Convoys.

Weâ€™ll briefly recap each project and the technologies behind them before looking at lessons-learned from working in the field with real humans in high-pressure situations that have zero margin for errors. Get a glimpse at what it means to use technology for good and why it matters that we sweat the details.

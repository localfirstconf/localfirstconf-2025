Early local first applications are all silos. Singular stand-alone apps, packed with technology. But my user data still ends up fragmented. Every application stores my data in its own way. Applications don't talk to one another. Its ridiculous!

What would it look like if the CRDTs and sync engine were pushed down into the operating system? What would happen if collaboratively editable objects replace the filesystem? You'd have an operating system where you can subscribe to anything. Where you can collaboratively edit any file on disk, across different users, different computers and different programs. It would be better for developers - we'd have to do much less work to write cool software. And better for users - who could use system tools to travel through time, in any app.

Crazy? Absolutely. But operating systems are made out of code too. Sometimes you need to flush your old assumptions to open your eyes to what's possible.

Lets dream big, and imagine a computer where the data flows freely.

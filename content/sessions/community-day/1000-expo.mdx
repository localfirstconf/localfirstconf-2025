## Workshop Overview

Join us for an immersive hands-on workshop where we'll build a multi-platform local-first application using Expo and LiveStore. You'll learn how to create apps that work seamlessly across devices. We'll explore the powerful LiveStore devtools to inspect and modify your app's data in real-time, and cover deployment strategies to get your app into users' hands.

## What You'll Learn

- Setting up a cross-platform Expo application
- Implementing local-first data architecture with LiveStore
- Using LiveStore devtools for debugging and data management
- Deploying your application to multiple platforms

## Prerequisites

- Clone the starter repository: [Expo LiveStore Workshop 2025 Starter](https://github.com/betomoedano/livestore-expo-starter.git)
- Install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) on your mobile device
- [Set up your development environment](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=expo-go&platform=ios&device=simulated) for running simulators/emulators on your computer

## Recommended Preparation

Before the workshop, we recommend:

- Running the starter project
- Opening the LiveStore devtools to familiarize yourself with the interface
- Either obtaining a license at [livestore.dev/sponsor](https://livestore.dev/sponsor) or activating the free trial when prompted in the devtools (the free trial is sufficient for this workshop)

Taking these steps will ensure you're ready to dive straight into development during the session.

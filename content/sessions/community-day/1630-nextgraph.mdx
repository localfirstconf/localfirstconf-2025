Sharing your skills in the social network is LinkedIn main feature. Not only can I list and rate my subjective own set of skills, but my peers can also endorse me and attest what am I skilled in. As LinkedIn is a centralized service, it constructs and maintains a centralized graph database that contains all its users. Querying it and matching needs and offers (of skills, or job positions, etc) is easy, as the developers of LinkedIn platform enjoy a direct global view on the social graph and all associated data.

When we switch to a decentralized and privacy-focused paradigm, things get complicated quickly. In a peer-to-peer setting, nobody ever has the “full picture”, so matching people together and issuing recommendations, do not work easily, or at all. Also, the issue of trust arises. A centralized system can verify claims quite easily. In a decentralized system, claims have to be self-signed, and a web of trust between peers needs to be maintained.

With NextGraph features of SPARQL queries traversing the social graph, associated with social sharing, and signatures on every bit of Linked Data, we can reimplement the same kind of algorithms and services, without any single point of failure, and while respecting the privacy of everyone.

In this live coding session, we will explore how to create a new app with NextGraph Framework, how users can fill-in their own skills’ profile, and rate the skills of others. Eventually, users will be able to search for skills in the social network, and obtain a ranked list of the best fit, based on selected criteria. Thanks to the local-first nature of the framework, editing your profile or browsing the results of a query can work offline too, and social queries also work in the event of intermittent connectivity. NextGraph being end-to-end encrypted at heart, all exchanges are safe and private, revealing nothing to the infrastructure and underlying servers, and letting users decide what they want to share with others. Eventually, data portability and interoperability being one of our main concerns, we will demonstrate how we prevent any lock-in and how users can switch to other apps, while remaining in total control over their own data.

PouchDB and CouchDB have been an absolute Local-First Dream Team since 2013. In this workshop, we’ll show you why. Join us for hands-on time with PouchDB itself, a look at a fleshed out demo app to see how PouchDB, CouchDB and app state fit together, and a quick glance at a convenient Open-Source way to easily host your own CouchDB.

We’ll cover:

* Local (in-client) data storage
* Client-to-Server data synchronisation
* Working offline and handling conflicts
* How to use database events to power your UI

See you there!
